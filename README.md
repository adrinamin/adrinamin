### Hi, I'm Adrin :wave:

I'm a software engineer and technology enthusiast. I'm currently working for the [vi:sit](https://vi-sit.com/) software company. We are realizing all kind of differnt projects based on .NET with high focus on testable software design and software architecture.

I deeply care about the role of technology in our society. I always try to find ways to use our craft and tools to improve our environment, and eventually peoples lifes. So that in the end, everybody can benefit from new technologies.

I'm always curious to learn new things :man_student:. I'm currently focusing to improve my skills in python, C++ and cloud computing.
