# Hi there

My name is Adrin and I'm a software engineer. 

I use GitHub for my personal projects and to learn new tech.

I'm not that obsessed about my GitHub stats or any dev tools that I use. I'm not very bound to a particular technology. I just love to learn new things. If you are interested, you can check out my repos. Maybe you'll find something useful 😊.

<!--
Apart from that, I thought to give you some joy with a quick dev joke 😁.
