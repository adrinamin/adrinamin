# Hi there

My name is Adrin and I'm a software engineer. 

I use GitHub for my personal projects and to learn new tech.

I'm not that obsessive about specific Github stats. If you are interested, you can check out my repos. Maybe you'll find something useful. Apart from that, I thought to give you some joy with a quick dev joke 😁.
